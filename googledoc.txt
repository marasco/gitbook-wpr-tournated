## 1) Overview

The USPA, in partnership with WPR, uses **Tournated TMS** for the end‑to‑end tournament flow: listing, player entry and payment, draws, schedules, and scores. This improves the experience for players, clubs, and TDs.

* **Players enter and pay** at **`https://uspa.worldpadelrating.com`**.
* **Entry fees** are paid **directly to the club** via the club’s **Stripe** connected to the TMS (real‑time).
* **TDs** are responsible for learning and operating the TMS; **WPR** and **USPA** provide support and oversight.

**Access & Setup (do this ≥ 8 weeks before your event):**

1. Email **[tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com)** with:

   * Public **name/email/phone** for the primary TD to display in the TMS.
   * **Names/emails** of any club staff who need TMS access.
2. You will receive:

   * **Login credentials** for **`manager.tournated.com`** (for you and any designated staff), and
   * A **Stripe connection link** to connect your club’s Stripe to TMS.
3. **Connect Stripe** using that link and email **[tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com)** once completed.
4. After Tournated confirms the Stripe connection and adds your staff to the organization/venue, you can **create your first tournament**.

  > Players should enter the division they would prefer to play in. If more teams enter than spaces are available, USPA rankings and WPR ratings will determine the divisions. See USPA Rule Book for complete details. If a team enters a division that the USPA determines is clearly below its ability, then the USPA has the right to move the team. Individual scheduling requests cannot be accommodated. Any questions about the tournament should be sent to the tournament director. The USPA and World Padel Rating teams are unable to answer tournament‑specific questions. To withdraw prior to the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must visit the tournament listing → click “My Details” or the ticket icon → click “Withdraw”. To change partners before the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must email the tournament director. To withdraw or change partners after the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must email the tournament director. In Division 1 of USPA 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000 and 500, partner changes are not allowed after the draw has been published. No refunds will be given for withdrawals after the entry/withdrawal deadline.

---

## 5) Approval & Public Listing

After submission, the USPA reviews and approves. Once approved, your event is publicly listed and open for entries at **`uspa.worldpadelrating.com`**. Complete this **≥ 8 weeks** before the event.

---

## 6) Entry Policy & Deadlines

**Player accounts:** Every player needs a **WPR profile** (to enter themselves or be entered as a partner).

**Membership requirements:**

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Free USPA account** is sufficient.
* **USPA 250+ & Age Group Regionals+:** **Paid USPA membership** required.
  The **registration page** will guide players to obtain any required credentials during entry.

* **All other USPA events:** **Thursday 12:00pm (noon) local time** (week **before** the tournament). You may accept **late entries** in TMS until **Sunday** (absolute cutoff) to allow USPA time to review entries and return seeding so you can publish by the required time.

---

## 7) Entries Review → Export & Send to USPA/WPR (for Seeding)

At the **Entry Deadline**:

1. Open the **Entries** tab and review the items below.
2. Make any necessary changes.
3. Click **Export → Download Data for All Categories** to obtain the **Entry List**.
4. Email the file to **[info@padelusa.org](mailto:info@padelusa.org)** and **[tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com)** for **seeding**.

### 7.1 What to review in **Entries**

**i) Divisions & Partners are correct**

* **Change a team’s division:** Click the **…** at far right → **Edit** → change **“Select category”**.
* **Change a partner:** Click **… → Edit** → replace the player by entering their **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** in the appropriate field.

  > Note: A player must hold the required **USPA account/membership** for the event to be added.
* **Withdraw a team:** Click **… → Withdraw Entry**.

**ii) Capacity check**

* Ensure total entries **do not exceed** your facility’s capacity. If they do, notify **USPA** (draw rules determine who qualifies) and **WPR** (to assist with refunding unselected teams).

**iii) Late entries** (if you accept them at your discretion)

* **Add late entry:** Click **+ Add new Entry** → enter the players’ **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** (any player with a WPR profile is retrievable—no extra sync required).

  > **Payments for late entries** are handled **outside TMS** by the club. You will see **“No Payment”** next to the team; use the orange **“+”** to **manually update** their status for record‑keeping.

**iv) Refunds for withdrawals**

* Issue refunds (as applicable) from your **Stripe dashboard**.

**v) Required draw format per entries**

* **Formatting summary:**

  * **≤ 5 teams:** 1 group (no playoff).
  * **6–7 teams:** 2 groups with **1st Place Playoff** (3rd/5th Place Playoffs optional at TD discretion).
  * **Round robin:** used for **≤ 7** teams.
  * **≥ 8 teams:** **First‑match‑loser consolation** draw format.
  * **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** More flexibility (confirm with USPA in advance).

---

## 8) Seeding (by USPA/WPR)

* After receiving your **Entry List**, USPA confirms points and returns the file with **seeds assigned**.
* **Seeding criteria:** USPA circuit **ranking points**, then **verified WPR player ratings**.
* **Seeds per draw size:**

  * **3–5 teams:** **0** seeds
  * **6–11 teams:** **2** seeds
  * **12–23 teams:** **4** seeds
  * **24–64 teams:** **8** seeds
* Seeds are **not arbitrary** and **must not** be changed by the TD.

---

## 9) Draws & Schedule (Tournament Desk)

**Publish deadlines:**

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Tuesday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).
* **All other USPA events:** **Monday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).

**Step‑by‑step:**

### 9.1 Unlock Tournament Desk

1. In the **Admin Desk** (`uspa.worldpadelrating.com/<yourclub>/Admin`):

   * **Tournaments →** open the **active tournament** → **Players → Player selections**.
   * Finalize selections **per event** (Men’s Doubles, Women’s Doubles, etc.) and then **All events**.
2. This unlocks the **“Launch Tournament Desk”** button (top right).

### 9.2 Create Draws

1. In **Tournament Desk → Events**, first add **all participants** into a temporary draw titled **“Interim draft”**.
2. For each division:

   * **Manage draws → Add draw**
   * **Add participants** (pick the teams for that division)
   * **Assign seeds:** Expand the navy **Participants** ribbon → **Manual Seeding** → enter seeds → **Save**
   * Click **Make Draw** and select the correct **draw format** (e.g., First‑match‑loser consolation; Round robin; Round robin with playoff using **Group position**).

     > If a wrong draw type is chosen, the draw must be remade; you cannot append playoffs afterward.
3. When all division draws are created, **Manage draws → Delete draws** for the temporary **“Interim draft”**.

### 9.3 Schedule Matches

* **Manual Scheduling:** Plan externally (sheet/notepad) and enter times in TMS.
* **Auto Scheduling:** Configure

  * **Match settings:** Estimated match length, minimum rest time.
  * **Manage facilities:** Court count and availability windows.
* **Review** any auto‑generated schedule and adjust match‑by‑match as needed.

**Scheduling guidelines:**

* Include **minimum rest time**, generally **90 minutes** (see USPA Rulebook for details).
* Respect **matches‑per‑day** maximums:

  * **USPA 2000, 1000, 500:** Max **two** main‑draw matches per day.
  * **USPA 250 & 100**, or where main‑draw uses a **3rd‑set tiebreaker:** up to **three** per day.

**Consolation (First‑match‑loser) notes:**

* **Main‑draw byes:** A team with a main‑draw **bye** may slot into consolation **if they lose** their first played match; the TMS adds a placeholder to be scheduled. If they **win**, upon score entry the placeholder is removed and the waiting team gets a **bye** to the next consolation round. Communicate dependencies to affected teams and monitor potential gaps.
* **Walkover logic:** TMS includes an extra round to handle the rare case where a team **wins by Walkover** in round 1, then **loses** its second match; that team may be allowed into consolation at TD discretion. Schedule the specific “slot‑in” matches (labeled lines like “1‑2”, “3‑4”) and explain the draw to players. It’s acceptable to leave the edge‑case matches unscheduled until needed.

### 9.4 Publish

* In **Schedule**: click the green **“Publish order of play”**.
* In **Events**: click the green **“Publish”**.

---

## 10) Score Entry (in‑tournament)

Enter scores directly in TMS; public draws update automatically. Format examples:

* **Set separator:** Use **colon `:`** → `6:4 6:7(5:7) [10:6]`
* **Tiebreak (set):** Inside **parentheses `()`** right after the set → `7:6(7:1)`
* **Match tiebreak:** Inside **square brackets `[]`** → `[10:6]`
* **Unfinished:** Leave set score empty or set **Match not finished** (status becomes **Upcoming**)
* **Save:** Select the winning team (click their name rectangle) to save the match.

---
