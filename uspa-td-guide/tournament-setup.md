# Tournament Setup

## Create Your Tournament (TMS → "+ Create → Tournament")

You can log in via **`manager.tournated.com`**. If your email is the same as your WPR player profile email, you can also log in via **uspa.worldpadelrating.com** (player portal) and then click **"Manager"** (top‑right menu).

## Settings → General

* **Categories:** Select **one by one**.
* **Payment method:** **Online**
* **Payment type:** **Per pair**
* **Number of courts:** Enter the number available for the tournament.

## Settings → Dates & Location

* **Entry Deadline & Withdrawal Deadline:** Use the **same date/time** (mind **time zones**).

  * **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Monday 8:00pm ET** (week of the tournament).
  * **All other USPA events:** **Thursday 12:00pm (local)** (week **before** the tournament).
* **Venue:** Select your club(s).

## Settings → Appearance

* **Logo:** Use your club logo (recommended).

* **Description:** Paste this **mandatory text** (edit only if instructed by USPA):

  > Players should enter the division they would prefer to play in. If more teams enter than spaces are available, USPA rankings and WPR ratings will determine the divisions. See USPA Rule Book for complete details. If a team enters a division that the USPA determines is clearly below its ability, then the USPA has the right to move the team. Individual scheduling requests cannot be accommodated. Any questions about the tournament should be sent to the tournament director. The USPA and World Padel Rating teams are unable to answer tournament‑specific questions. To withdraw prior to the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must visit the tournament listing → click "My Details" or the ticket icon → click "Withdraw". To change partners before the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must email the tournament director. To withdraw or change partners after the entry/withdrawal deadline, players must email the tournament director. In Division 1 of USPA 2500, 2000, 1500, 1000 and 500, partner changes are not allowed after the draw has been published. No refunds will be given for withdrawals after the entry/withdrawal deadline.

* **Tournament Poster:** Upload a **800 × 800** poster (follow USPA guidelines).

* **Cover Banner:** Upload a **2400 × 600** banner (current dimensions differ from previous templates; use the latest USPA guidelines).

## Settings → Schedule (Optional)

Use for **high‑level events** (e.g., player party, practice court blocks) to appear on the public page. **Do not** enter specific match times here (those are set later).

## Settings → Tournament Registration

* **Additional Questions:** Add custom fields (e.g., T‑shirt size, image upload). Can be per category and mandatory/optional.
* **Terms & Conditions:** Paste club/venue waiver or similar text for acceptance at entry.
* **External Registration Link:** Redirects the "Register" button elsewhere. **Generally not recommended** (players should register in TMS).

* **Email Notifications:** Enable/disable notifications to TD and players for new/approved entries.
