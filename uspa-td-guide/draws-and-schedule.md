# Draws & Schedule (Tournament Desk)

## Publish Deadlines

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Tuesday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).
* **All other USPA events:** **Monday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).

## Step‑by‑step

### Unlock Tournament Desk

1. In the **Admin Desk** (`uspa.worldpadelrating.com/<yourclub>/Admin`):

   * **Tournaments →** open the **active tournament** → **Players → Player selections**.
   * Finalize selections **per event** (Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, etc.) and then **All events**.
2. This unlocks the **"Launch Tournament Desk"** button (top right).

### Create Draws

1. In **Tournament Desk → Events**, first add **all participants** into a temporary draw titled **"Interim draft"**.
2. For each division:

   * **Manage draws → Add draw**
   * **Add participants** (pick the teams for that division)
   * **Assign seeds:** Expand the navy **Participants** ribbon → **Manual Seeding** → enter seeds → **Save**
   * Click **Make Draw** and select the correct **draw format** (e.g., First‑match‑loser consolation; Round robin; Round robin with playoff using **Group position**).

     > If a wrong draw type is chosen, the draw must be remade; you cannot append playoffs afterward.
3. When all division draws are created, **Manage draws → Delete draws** for the temporary **"Interim draft"**.

### Schedule Matches

* **Manual Scheduling:** Plan externally (sheet/notepad) and enter times in TMS.
* **Auto Scheduling:** Configure

  * **Match settings:** Estimated match length, minimum rest time.
  * **Manage facilities:** Court count and availability windows.
* **Review** any auto‑generated schedule and adjust match‑by‑match as needed.

**Scheduling guidelines:**

* Include **minimum rest time**, generally **90 minutes** (see USPA Rulebook for details).
* Respect **matches‑per‑day** maximums:

  * **USPA 2000, 1000, 500:** Max **two** main‑draw matches per day.
  * **USPA 250 & 100**, or where main‑draw uses a **3rd‑set tiebreaker:** up to **three** per day.

**Consolation (First‑match‑loser) notes:**

* **Main‑draw byes:** A team with a main‑draw **bye** may slot into consolation **if they lose** their first played match; the TMS adds a placeholder to be scheduled. If they **win**, upon score entry the placeholder is removed and the waiting team gets a **bye** to the next consolation round. Communicate dependencies to affected teams and monitor potential gaps.
* **Walkover logic:** TMS includes an extra round to handle the rare case where a team **wins by Walkover** in round 1, then **loses** its second match; that team may be allowed into consolation at TD discretion. Schedule the specific "slot‑in" matches (labeled lines like "1‑2", "3‑4") and explain the draw to players. It's acceptable to leave the edge‑case matches unscheduled until needed.
