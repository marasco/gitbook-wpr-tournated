## What to Review in Entries

### i) Divisions & Partners are correct

> Note: The TD is advised to notify players affected by changes, if any.

* **Change a team's division:** Click the **…** at far right → **Edit** → change **"Select category"**.
* **Change a partner:** Click **… → Edit** → replace the player by entering their **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** in the appropriate field.

  > Note: A player must hold the required **USPA account/membership** for the tournament to be added.
* **Withdraw a team:** Click **… → Withdraw Entry**.

### ii) Capacity check

* Ensure total entries **do not exceed** your facility's capacity. If they do, notify **USPA** (whose draw rules determine who qualifies).

### iii) Late entries (if you accept them at your discretion)

* **Add late entry:** Click **+ Add new Entry** → enter the players' **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** (any player with a WPR profile is retrievable—no extra sync required).

  > **Payments for late entries** are handled **outside TMS** by the club. You will see **"No Payment"** next to the team; use the orange **"+"** to **manually update** their status for record‑keeping.

### iv) Refunds for withdrawals

* Issue refunds (as applicable) from your **Stripe dashboard**.

### v) Required draw format per entries

* **Formatting summary:**

  * Minimum 3 teams required to make a draw. <3 teams = cancelled & refunded.
  * **≤ 5 teams:** 1 group (no playoff).
  * **6–7 teams:** 2 groups with **1st Place Playoff** (3rd/5th Place Playoffs optional at TD discretion).
  * **Round robin:** used for **≤ 7** teams.
  * **≥ 8 teams:** **First‑match‑loser consolation** draw format.
  * **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** More flexibility (confirm with USPA in advance).
