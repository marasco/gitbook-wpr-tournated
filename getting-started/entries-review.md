# Entries Review & Export

## Overview


At the **Entry Deadline**:

1. Open the **Entries** tab for your tournament in the TMS (manager.tournated.com) and the seeding **Entry List** spreadsheet file the USPA will have emailed to you, to review the items below.
2. Make any necessary changes. (Complete the below **What to Review in Entries** checklist.)
3. Enter the changes you've made in the TMS in the seeding **Entry List** spreadsheet file the USPA emailed you. Your TMS Entries tab should match this file after implementing changes in both. (To assist in organization, you may click **Export → Download Data for All Categories** to obtain the **Entry List** file containing your changes made in the TMS, if any -- but note this does not contain ranking points/seedings, while the USPA file does.) Be mindful in the USPA file to cut-and-paste ranking points along with player info for division & changes, if any. 
4. If any changes - i.e. late entries and/or teams changing divisions and/or partner changes -, seeding may be impacted; determine updated seeding in the original **Entry List** spreadsheet file the USPA emailed you. See Step "5. Seeding" Instructions for details.

## What to Review in Entries

### i) Divisions & Partners are correct

> Note: The TD is advised to notify players affected by changes, if any, whether division changes, division cancellations, etc. Teams must consent to division changes before the TD can make the change in USPA-sanctioned tournaments. Divisions are cancelled if <3 teams. TDs may want to change teams' divisions for competitive balance (WPR ratings and your local knowledge of players' levels are helpful here) or for numbers. Women are permitted to play Men's divisions, but do not receive USPA ranking points for matches played in Men's.

* **Change a team's division:** Click the **…** at far right → **Edit** → change **"Select category"**.
* **Change a partner:** Click **… → Edit** → replace the player by entering their **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** in the appropriate field.

  > Note: A player must hold the required **USPA account/membership** for the tournament to be added.
* **Withdraw a team:** Click **… → Withdraw Entry**.

### ii) Capacity check

* Ensure total entries **do not exceed** your facility's capacity. If they do, notify **USPA**. (USPA rules & regulations would then determine who qualifies.)

### iii) Late entries (if you accept them at your discretion)

* **Add late entry:** Click **+ Add new Entry** → enter the players' **WPR ID** or **WPR‑associated email** (any player with a WPR profile is retrievable—no extra sync required). (The player needs to provide you their ID or email.)

  > **Payments for late entries** are handled **outside TMS** by the club. You will see **"No Payment"** next to the team; use the orange **"+"** to **manually update** their status for record‑keeping.

### iv) Refunds for withdrawals

* Issue refunds (as applicable) from your **Stripe dashboard**. Refunds are to be given for withdrawals before the Entry Deadline, but are not required to be given for withdrawals after the Entry Deadline.

### v) Required draw format per entries

* **Formatting summary:**

  * Minimum 3 teams required to make a draw. <3 teams = cancelled & refunded.
  * **≤ 5 teams:** 1 group (no playoff).
  * **6–7 teams:** 2 groups with **1st Place Playoff** (3rd/5th Place Playoffs optional at TD discretion).
  * **Round robin:** used for **≤ 7** teams.
  * **≥ 8 teams:** **First‑match‑loser consolation** draw format.
  * **USPA 100:** More flexibility (confirm with USPA in advance).
