# Seeding

## Overview

* USPA
  * Downloads the **Entry List** from the TMS at the Entry Deadline, then shares with the TD an updated version with points inputted and seeds assigned. (Seeding criteria: 1) USPA circuit ranking points, then 2) verified WPR player ratings.)
* TD (do 1 of the following 2):
  * If no late entries, no teams changing divisions, and no partner changes, you are ready to input seedings in the TMS. To do so, navigate to your tournament’s Entries tab (left hand side), use the orange dropdown menu to access the respective divisions you are running, find the Seeding column, click the pencil icon next to name of any team that is seeded (reference the Entry List file shared with you by USPA) in each of the respective divisions.
  * If any late entries and/or any teams changing divisions and/or partner changes, ***IMPORTANT** Note: The Entry List shared with you by the USPA is then stale and seedings may change. Having added late entries per Step 4.iii above and made teams’ division changes and partner changes per Step 4.i above, in your tournament’s Entries tab on manager.tournated.com click **Export → Download Data for All Categories** to obtain the updated **Entry List** file containing your changes. To determine seeding, consult USPA ranking points in Column C of these ranking lists: Women, Men -- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOASWGurpauWqPAWxVNB1lPb6DYtXftg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108602083471399457205&rtpof=true&sd=true, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UzFDUtBNjUxHGGcFe1dC6s43hbfCUf37/edit?gid=953756506#gid=953756506. The seeding formula = Player1’s points + Player2’s points = Team’s total points. The highest # of total points in a division is the #1 seed, etc. (*Note that if a woman is playing in a Men’s draw, their Women’s ranking points are n/a for seeding purposes.) Input seeding in your updated Entry List file. Then, navigate to your tournament’s Entries tab, use the orange dropdown menu to access the respective divisions you are running, find the Seeding column, click the pencil icon next to name of any team that is seeded (reference your updated Entry List file) in each of the respective divisions.
