# Tournament Setup

## Create Your Tournament (TMS → "+ Create → Tournament")

You can log in via [manager.tournated.com](https://manager.tournated.com). If your email is the same as your WPR player profile email, you can also log in via [uspa-tournaments.worldpadelrating.com](https://uspa-tournaments.worldpadelrating.com) (player portal) and then click **"Manager"** (top‑right menu).
