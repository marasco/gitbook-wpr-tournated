# Tournament Setup

## Create Your Tournament (TMS → "+ Create → Tournament")

You can log in via [manager.tournated.com](https://manager.tournated.com). If your email is the same as your WPR player profile email, you can also log in via [uspa.worldpadelrating.com](https://uspa.worldpadelrating.com) (player portal) and then click **"Manager"** (top‑right menu).

## Calendar & Lead Time

* Confirm your event is listed on the **USPA Calendar**.
* **Lead time:** TDs should log in and learn the TMS **at least 8 weeks** before the tournament.

**Cancellation policy (summary):** Tournaments may be automatically **canceled 3 weeks** before the scheduled date if the host club has not submitted their entry fee and created/submitted their tournament. Multiple reminder emails are sent starting 90 days out. Stay responsive and submit required materials on time to avoid removal from the calendar.
