# Score Entry (in‑tournament)

## Overview

Enter scores directly in TMS; public draws update automatically.

## Steps

* **Edit match:** Click “Edit match” / pencil icon button on a match for score entry popup to appear.
* **Enter score:** In the square fields.
* **Ensure correct winning team:** Select the winning team (click their name rectangle or the trophy icon next to it).
* **Save:** Click orange “Save” button.
* ***IMPORTANT** Note: TD Responsibility: All matches must have both a score and a scheduled date & time entered before 11:59pm local time of the last day of the tournament. Missing data blocks the match results upload to the WPR rating database/player profiles. (Reminder: Do not schedule a player in 2 matches at the same time, even in Walkover situations, as this creates errors in the results upload to the WPR rating database.)

* Nothing else is required to close out a tournament besides ensuring ^.
