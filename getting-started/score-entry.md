# Score Entry (in‑tournament)

## Overview

Enter scores directly in TMS; public draws update automatically.

## Steps

* **Edit match:** Click “Edit match” / pencil icon button on a match for score entry popup to appear.
* **Enter score:** In the square fields.
* **Ensure correct winning team:** Select the winning team (click their name rectangle or the trophy icon next to it).
* **Save:** Click orange “Save” button.
* ***IMPORTANT** Note: TD Responsibility: All matches must have both a score and a scheduled date & time entered before 11:59pm local time of the last day of the tournament. Missing data blocks the match results upload to the WPR rating database/player profiles. (Reminder: Do not schedule a player in 2 matches at the same time, even in Walkover situations, as this creates errors in the results upload to the WPR rating database.) The publishing of your tournament's match results upload to WPR player profiles occurs by the Friday following your tournament, if not sooner, if all required data is entered. 

* Nothing else is required to close out a tournament besides ensuring ^.
