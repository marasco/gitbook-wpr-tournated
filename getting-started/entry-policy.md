# 3. Entry Policy & Deadlines

## Entries Open

TDs should encourage all players to enter on the tournament's registration page prior to the entry deadline. All players need a **WPR profile**, whether that is to enter themselves or to be entered as someone's partner.

If a player cannot enter on their own, a TD may choose to assist with the entry. WPR cannot assist in manually entering players.

## Membership Requirements

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Free USPA account** is sufficient.
* **USPA 250+ & Age Group Regionals+:** **Paid USPA membership** required.

The **registration page** will guide players to obtain any required credentials during entry.

## Entry Deadlines

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Monday 11:00pm local time** (tournament week). **No late entries** (zero tolerance).
* **USPA 250+ & Age Group Regionals+:** **Thursday 11:00pm local time** (week **before** the tournament). You may accept **late entries**, entering them yourself in the TMS; keep in mind the need to yourself determine their seeding, if any, by consulting USPA ranking points: Women, Men -- [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOASWGurpauWqPAWxVNB1lPb6DYtXftg/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=108602083471399457205\&rtpof=true\&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOASWGurpauWqPAWxVNB1lPb6DYtXftg/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=108602083471399457205\&rtpof=true\&sd=true), [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UzFDUtBNjUxHGGcFe1dC6s43hbfCUf37/edit?gid=953756506#gid=953756506](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UzFDUtBNjUxHGGcFe1dC6s43hbfCUf37/edit?gid=953756506#gid=953756506), and to do so with enough time to publish draws & schedule before the Monday 3pm local time publish deadline.
