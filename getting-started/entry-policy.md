# Entry Policy & Deadlines

## Entries Open

TDs should encourage all players to enter on the tournament's registration page prior to the entry deadline. All players need a **WPR profile**, whether that is to enter themselves or to be entered as someone's partner.

If a player cannot enter on their own, a TD may choose to assist with the entry. WPR cannot assist in manually entering players.

## Membership Requirements

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Free USPA account** is sufficient.
* **USPA 250+ & Age Group Regionals+:** **Paid USPA membership** required.

The **registration page** will guide players to obtain any required credentials during entry.

## Entry Deadlines

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Monday 8:00pm ET** (tournament week). **No late entries** (zero tolerance).
* **All other USPA events:** **Thursday 12:00pm (noon) local time** (week **before** the tournament). You may accept **late entries** in TMS until **Sunday** (absolute cutoff) to allow USPA time to review entries and return seeding so you can publish by the required time.
