# 3. Entry Policy & Deadlines

## Entries Open

TDs should encourage all players to enter on the tournament's registration page prior to the entry deadline. All players need **1) a free WPR profile (worldpadelrating.com) for any tournament + 2) either a free USPA account or a paid USPA membership (padelusa.org/members) depending on the tournament**, whether that is to enter themselves or to be entered as someone's partner.

If a player cannot enter on their own, a TD may choose to assist with the entry. WPR cannot assist in manually entering players.
