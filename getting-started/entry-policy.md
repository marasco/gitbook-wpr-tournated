# Entry Policy & Deadlines

## Player Accounts

Every player needs a **WPR profile** (to enter themselves or be entered as a partner).

## Membership Requirements

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Free USPA account** is sufficient.
* **USPA 250+ & Age Group Regionals+:** **Paid USPA membership** required.

The **registration page** will guide players to obtain any required credentials during entry.

## Deadlines

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local:** **Monday 8:00pm ET** (tournament week). **No late entries** (zero tolerance).
* **All other USPA events:** **Thursday 12:00pm (noon) local time** (week **before** the tournament). You may accept **late entries** in TMS until **Sunday** (absolute cutoff) to allow USPA time to review entries and return seeding so you can publish by the required time.
