# 1. Account Setup

## Access & Setup

**Do this at least 8 weeks before your event:**

1. Email [info@padelusa.org](mailto:info@padelusa.org) & [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) with:
   * **Your tournament poster**, following guidelines ([https://padelusa.org/flier/](https://padelusa.org/flier/)): 1200 x 1700 (horizontal x vertical) with 100 pixel border zone at top & bottom, required USPA sponsor logos, etc.
   * **Name(s) & email(s)** of any club staff who need TMS access.
2. \*Connect your Stripe account to the TMS, and email [info@padelusa.org](account-setup.md#access-and-setup) & [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](account-setup.md#access-and-setup) to notify when done. (\*Required only once, for the first tournament you run.):
   * A **Stripe OAuth connection link** will be sent to you via email. The link expires, so please complete the following **ASAP**.
   * Copy-and-paste the link into a web browser on a desktop.
   * On the link's login/sign-up page: If your club already has a Stripe account, log in using those details. If you do not, you will need to create one then log in (currently Stripe is the only payment processor supported by the TMS.) To complete the Stripe account connection to your TMS account, you will need the Stripe email, password, SSN or EIN, and possibly bank details (including the business address on file with Stripe). If you need someone else at the club to connect the Stripe account such as the owner or accountant, then forward them this email and follow up with them.
   * When Stripe prompts you, grant access to the TMS platform.
   * Reply-all to the email including [info@padelusa.org](../training-resources/draws/single-elimination.md) & [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](account-setup.md#access-and-setup) to notify when done.
3. \*Receive via email and test **login credentials** for [manager.tournated.com](https://manager.tournated.com). (\*Required only once, for the first tournament you run.)
