# Account Setup

## Access & Setup

**Do this at least 8 weeks before your event:**

1. Email **[tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com)** with:

   * Public **name/email/phone** for the primary TD to display in the TMS.
   * **Names/emails** of any club staff who need TMS access.
2. You will receive:

   * **Login credentials** for **`manager.tournated.com`** (for you and any designated staff), and
   * A **Stripe connection link** to connect your club's Stripe to TMS.
3. **Connect Stripe** using that link and email **[tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com)** once completed.
4. After Tournated confirms the Stripe connection and adds your staff to the organization/venue, you can **create your first tournament**.

## Calendar & Lead Time

* Confirm your event is listed on the **USPA Calendar**.
* **Lead time:** TDs should log in and learn the TMS **at least 8 weeks** before the tournament.

**Cancellation policy (summary):** Tournaments may be automatically **canceled 3 weeks** before the scheduled date if the host club has not submitted their entry fee and created/submitted their tournament. Multiple reminder emails are sent starting 90 days out. Stay responsive and submit required materials on time to avoid removal from the calendar.
