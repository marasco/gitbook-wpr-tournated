# Account Setup

## Access & Setup

**Do this at least 8 weeks before your event:**

1. Email [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) with:

   * Public **name/email/phone** for the primary TD to display in the TMS.
   * **Names/emails** of any club staff who need TMS access.
2. You will receive:

   * **Login credentials** for [manager.tournated.com](https://manager.tournated.com) (for you and any designated staff), and
   * A **Stripe connection link** to connect your club's Stripe to TMS.
3. **Connect Stripe** using that link and email [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) once completed.
4. After Tournated confirms the Stripe connection and adds your staff to the organization/venue, you can **create your first tournament**.
