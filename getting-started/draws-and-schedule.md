## Scheduling

Please remember when scheduling to include minimum rest time for players – generally 90 minutes (search “rest” in USPA rulebook for details), and to adhere to “matches per day” maximums (“two main draw matches per day in USPA 2000, 1000 and 500. In USPA 250 and 100, or where main draw matches utilize a 3rd set tiebreaker, three matches may be scheduled in one day”).

## Publish Deadlines

TDs must publish the draws & schedule by the following times or earlier, and inform [info@padelusa.org](mailto:info@padelusa.org) and [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) when they are complete:
