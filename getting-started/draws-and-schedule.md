# Draws & Schedule

Once Seeding is complete, the TD can create the draws & schedule.

## Draws

* For each respective division a.k.a. category you are running:
    * i) Select from the sidebar menu either “Group Stage” (for Round Robin) or “Knockout Stage” (for First-match-loser-consolation – and, if applicable, for Playoff stage of Round Robin) depending on the USPA “Required draw format per entries” count in that division (see Instructions 4.v).
    * ii) Select the division a.k.a. category from the “All Categories” orange button dropdown.
    * iii) Click “+ Create” (or “+ Add new”) to start to make the draw. Then, in the popup form:
      * **For First-match-loser-consolation:**
         * 	Draw title = same name as the category e.g. “Men’s Div 1”
         * 	***IMPORTANT:** Select (checkbox yes) “Add first match losers to consolation draw”
         * 	De-select (checkbox no) “Publish draw after creation”. (Later, click orange “Publish Now” button top right later once all draws & schedules done and double-checked in case of errors.)
         * 	(Leave all other Settings as the default.)
         * 	Click “ADD DRAW”. The Main draw and the Consolation (FMLC) draw are both automatically created. (You can find the Consolation draw by clicking on the grey dropdown menu button that says “Main” and selecting “Consolation”.)
      * **For Round Robin:**
         * 	Draw title = same name as the category e.g. “Men’s Div 1”
         * 	Groups type = Multiple (if 6-7 teams) or Single (if 3-5 teams)
         * 	Number of groups = 2 (if 6-7 teams) or 1 (if 3-5 teams)
         * 	De-select (checkbox no) “Publish groups after creation”. (Later, click orange “Publish Now” button top right later once all draws & schedules done and double-checked in case of errors.)
         * 	(Leave all other Settings as the default.)
         * 	Click “Submit”.
      * **For Round Robin Playoff(s) (if applicable) – create in “Knockout Stage” tab upfront along with Round Robin group stage to be able to include in Schedule planning**:
         * 	Draw title = same name as the category, + playoff name e.g. “Men’s Div 1 1st Place Playoff”
         * 	Templates size = 2
         * 	Generate Draw = From Group Results (Manual)
         * 	De-select (checkbox no) “Publish draw after creation”. (Later, click orange “Publish Now” button top right later once all draws & schedules done and double-checked in case of errors.)
         * 	(Leave all other Settings as the default.)
         * 	Click “ADD DRAW”.
         * 	…Repeat for each playoff match, e.g. if also running “Men’s Div 1 3rd Place Playoff”, “Men’s Div 1 5th Place Playoff”, etc.
         * 	Manually input top teams from the group stage into the playoff match slots using the “+Add team” button in the playoff draw.
  
  Below are a couple screenshots of a group (a.k.a. round robin) and a knockout (a.k.a. FMLC) with entries:

## Scheduling

Once all draws are complete, the TD can do scheduling. There are 3 methods to do scheduling: 

1. Via the Knockouts tab and Groups tab: Click on each match “Edit match” individually to enter match times - be mindful of AM:PM. (Remember to enter a court to best make use of the TMS's Order of Play functionality.) Cross-reference the Grid on the Order of Play tab, which populates as you do this, to check for no match conflicts.

2. Via 'Matches bank' drag & drop: Navigate to the Order of Play tab. Expand the "Matches" horizontal rectangle; inside it, tick all the boxes (i.e. all Category and all Bracket) to in effect Select All - i.e. all your tournaments' matches. Recommended: tickbox "Show only unscheduled matches", so that this 'Matches bank' visually empties as you schedule matches. To schedule matches from here, drag & drop a match from the bank into the grid below in your desired time & court slot. Be sure to click "Save" after each one. (You can click on a match in the grid to access a pop-out window to also edit the date, time & court.) (Scroll up to find on the left hand side a dropdown menu with the data (for e.g. switching the grid from Saturday to Sunday of your tournament.)

3. Via Generate-->Order of Play (Schedule) button auto-scheduler: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**. Currently, if you click this (make sure to do x2 - once in the Groups tab for Groups format draws, once in the Knockout tab for Knockout format draws -), all matches populate into the grid on the Order of Play tab, but with only basic logic (i.e. R1 before R2, but not incorporating rest times, maximum matches per day, etc.) and with potential conflicts between Groups matches and Knockout matches. The TD is advised to review closely and reshuffle significantly if using this method.

In all cases for any method, it is recommended to have at least a basic sketch if not spreadsheet of desired schedule next to you as you complete scheduling in the software. 



Please remember when scheduling to include minimum rest time for players – generally 90 minutes (search “rest” in USPA rulebook for details), and to adhere to “matches per day” maximums (“two main draw matches per day in USPA 2000, 1000 and 500. In USPA 250 and 100, or where main draw matches utilize a 3rd set tiebreaker, three matches may be scheduled in one day”).

As much as possible, schedule matches such that upcoming opponents will have equal rest prior to their match – i.e. If the final is at 1pm, both semis should be at 10am rather than one semi at 10am and one semi at 9am. 

Do not schedule a player in 2 matches at the same time, even in Walkover situations, as this creates errors in the results upload to the WPR rating database.

**IMPORTANT:** Scheduling of consolation matches for ‘First match loser consolation’ format draws in divisions where there are main draws with byes: The team with a main draw bye (often a seed) may (if they lose) or may not (if they win) slot into the consolation draw. If the former, enter a bye in the consolation draw on the line where they would have slotted in had they lost, advancing their would-be consolation opponent to the next round. If the latter, upon score entry for the relevant main draw match they are automatically slotted into the consolation draw. TDs should keep in mind in these scenarios to: 
  * i) only schedule first round consolation match times for after the second round of a corresponding main draw is completed, 
  * ii) communicate to awaiting teams that their consolation match time depends on the outcome of a main draw match, 
  * iii) be aware that outcomes of main draw matches may create gaps of unused court time in your schedule if a consolation match becomes n/a.

**TIP:** Once done scheduling, use the Order of Play (left sidebar) --> "Matches" bank to double-check that there are no matches missing having been scheduled. To do so, use the down arrow on the right side of the "Matches" bank rectangle to expand the bank, then select all "Categories", all "Bracket" and checkbox the "Show only unscheduled matches" -- the matches bank should be empty if there are no matches missing scheduling.

**TIP:** Project the Order of Play with auto-scroll onto a TV screen in your club. To do so, in the Order of Play tab, click the TV icon button. This cycles through all the tournament's matches in a grid view, noting scores as you enter them and noting which matches are Completed vs. Upcoming. (Matches must be assigned courts in order to make use of Order of Play functionality.)

**TIP:** In case of e.g. rain: Can navigate in Order of Play tab to Bird’s View, click “Select all” (or select the matches in question individually), then click the “Move” button that appears and in the popup move all the matches, e.g., 2h later.


## Publish Deadlines

TDs must publish the draws & schedule by the following times or earlier, and inform [info@padelusa.org](mailto:info@padelusa.org) and [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) when they are complete:

* **USPA 100 tournaments:** **Tuesday 3:00pm local time** (tournament week).
* **USPA 250+ & Seniors tournaments:** **Monday 3:00pm local time** (tournament week).

> **Important:** Clubs that do not publish draws & schedule on time risk the cancellation of future tournaments by the USPA.

**TO PUBLISH:** Publish only once you've double-checked the draws and schedule, to avoid confusion of revising public content. To publish, click the orange "Publish now" button near the top right of all three of the i) Group Stage tab, ii) Knockout Stage tab, iii) Order of Play tab.
