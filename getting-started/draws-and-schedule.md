# Draws & Schedule

Once the USPA has completed seedings on the Entry List, the TD can create the draws & schedule.

## Publish Deadlines

TDs must publish the draws & schedule by the following times or earlier, and inform [info@padelusa.org](mailto:info@padelusa.org) and [tduspa@worldpadelrating.com](mailto:tduspa@worldpadelrating.com) when they are complete:

* **USPA 100 & Age Group Local tournaments:** **Tuesday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).
* **All other USPA tournaments:** **Monday 2:00pm ET** (tournament week).

> **Important:** Clubs that do not publish draws & schedule by Tuesday 2pm ET (for USPA 100 & Age Group Local tournaments) / Monday 2pm ET (for all other USPA tournaments) risk the cancellation of future tournaments by the USPA.
